# Data Science in Pure JS

An attempt to complete a data science project from start to finish in JavaScript.

Goals:
1. Setup a REPL environment for Data Science experimentation using Jupyter Notebooks for JavaScript
2. Find an appropriate Data Frame type library, e.g.: https://www.npmjs.com/package/dataframe-js https://codepen.io/kurt_cagle/post/dataframes-come-to-javascript
3. Explore the use of Apache Arrow and sharing in-memory data with Python and calling python scripts with no time loss (https://arrow.apache.org/docs/js/)
4. Model development in JavaScript with Tensorflow.js (https://www.tensorflow.org/js)
5. Creating an inference endpoint in JavaScript using Node and Tensorflow.js
